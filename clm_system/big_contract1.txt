A "Force Majeure Event" means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of a Party that prevents or materially delays the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes), war, terrorism, riots, civil unrest, government actions or restrictions, embargoes, sanctions, strikes, labor disputes, power outages, or disruptions in transportation or supply chains, provided such event is not caused by the affected Party’s negligence or willful misconduct.
14.2 Notification
The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event (the "Affected Party") shall promptly notify the other Party in writing within five (5) Business Days of becoming aware of the Force Majeure Event, providing reasonable details of the event, its anticipated impact on performance, and the estimated duration of the delay.
14.3 Mitigation
The Affected Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance of its obligations as soon as practicable. The Affected Party shall keep the other Party informed of any material developments and the steps being taken to address the Force Majeure Event.
14.4 Suspension of Obligations
If a Force Majeure Event prevents or materially delays the Affected Party’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement, such obligations shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, provided the Affected Party complies with the notification and mitigation requirements of this Section 14. Neither Party shall be liable for any damages or penalties resulting from such suspension.
14.5 Termination for Prolonged Force Majeure
If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than ninety (90) consecutive days and materially prevents the Affected Party from performing its obligations, either Party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other Party, as specified in Section 5.4 (Termination for Force Majeure). Such termination shall take effect immediately upon receipt of the notice, subject to the provisions of Section 5.5 (Effect of Termination).
14.6 No Relief for Payment Obligations
A Force Majeure Event shall not excuse or delay the Distributor’s obligation to pay any amounts due under this Agreement for Products already delivered to the Delivery Point prior to the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Supplier.

15. Dispute Resolution
15.1 Negotiation
In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its interpretation, performance, or breach (a "Dispute"), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations. The Party raising the Dispute shall provide written notice to the other Party, describing the nature of the Dispute in reasonable detail. The Parties’ designated representatives, as specified in Section 3 (Parties), shall meet (in person or via teleconference) within ten (10) Business Days of such notice to discuss and attempt to resolve the Dispute.
15.2 Mediation
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation within thirty (30) days of the initial notice, the Parties shall submit the Dispute to non-binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed-upon mediation service in Malaysia. The mediation shall be conducted by a single mediator selected by the Parties or, if the Parties cannot agree within ten (10) Business Days, appointed by the mediation service. The mediation shall take place within sixty (60) days of the failure to resolve the Dispute through negotiation, and the costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties, unless otherwise agreed.
15.3 Arbitration
If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within ninety (90) days of the initial notice, the Dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the Asian International Arbitration Centre (AIAC) in accordance with its Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of the arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in Malaysia by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AIAC Rules. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
15.4 Exceptions
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek interim or equitable relief, such as an injunction or specific performance, from a court of competent jurisdiction as specified in Section 16 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction), without first pursuing negotiation or mediation, if such relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo pending resolution of the Dispute.
15.5 Costs
Each Party shall bear its own costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with negotiation and mediation. In arbitration, the arbitrator may allocate costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the prevailing Party, in accordance with the AIAC Rules.
15.6 Confidentiality
All negotiations, mediations, and arbitrations conducted pursuant to this Section 15 shall be treated as Confidential Information under Section 9 (Confidentiality), and the Parties shall ensure that all related communications and documents remain confidential, except as required by applicable law or to enforce an arbitral award.
15.7 Continuation of Obligations
During the pendency of any Dispute resolution process, the Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, to the extent such performance is not directly affected by the Dispute, unless the Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 5 (Term and Termination).

16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

Subject to Section 15 (Dispute Resolution), the Parties irrevocably agree that the courts of Malaysia shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).
